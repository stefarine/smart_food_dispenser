# Step 2 : Keep track on google cloud storage

### In this step we will configure a bucket on Google Cloud Storage and a Google Cloud Function to keep track of the date and time of when the food tank is empty.

To start, activate Google Cloud Storage on the same project as in step 1 and create a new Bucket like in the image below. Configure the bucket as you like and choose a name.
