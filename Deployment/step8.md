# Step 8 : Setting up the webapp

### In this part we will show you how to set up a webapp that will be able to visualize the data, change dispenser parameters, and compute some predictions. 

Download and open [this file](https://github.com/stefarine/smart_food_dispenser/blob/main/Code/WebApp/webapp_dispenser.ipynb) into any notebooks interface (Jupyter, Google colab, etc). 

1. Run the first cell to install the required packages.

2. Run this second cell and login with your project Google Cloud Account.

3. Modify the following line before running the third cell.

4. Modifify those lines before running the fourth cell.

5. You could now run the webapp locally. But to run it on the web, you will have to create a ngrok account. 
First, go to [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and click on sign up for free.
Once you are logged in, click on `Your Authtoken` on the left menu, and copy it.

  Now go back to the notebook, and copy your authtoken in the fifth cell, replacing `AUTH_TOKEN`. Run the cell.

6. Run the sixth cell. The address to your webapp will be printed, like in the following image. (the address is on the line starting with `Streamlit app running at NgrokTunnel:`. In this case the address is `https://4690-35-199-161-15.ngrok-free.app` but it will change every time you restard the ngrok app.
