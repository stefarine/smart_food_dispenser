## Overview of the project

The aim of this project is to deploy a smart dog food dispenser. The device will allow you to feed your dog while collecting data. You will be able to know how often the animal eats and also to have an eye on its food consumption. Indeed, the device allows you to track how often the container is empty.

The device is able to detect when a dog is in front of it and can serve a portion of food.for this purpose the camera uses a motion detector which, when a movement is detected, triggers the camera. The captured photo is then processed by Google Vision AI, to determine if it is a dog or not.
